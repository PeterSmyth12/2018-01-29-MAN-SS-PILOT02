<h2>General Information</h2>

<!--
  INTRODUCTION

  Edit the general explanatory paragraph below if you want to change
  the pitch.
-->
<p>
<a href=http://datacarpentry.org>Data Carpentry</a> workshops are for any researcher 
who has data they want to analyze, and no prior computational experience is required. 
This hands-on workshop teaches basic concepts, skills and tools for working more 
effectively with data. 
</p>
<p>
This is the second of two pilot workshops for the Social Sciences curriculum currently under development at the University of Manchester.
In this workshop we will teach the R programming language materials. The Python language materials were covered in the first workshop. 
Spreadsheets, OpenRefine and SQL will be taught in both. 
</p>

<p>
We will cover {{page.day1_am}}, {{page.day1a_am}} , {{page.day1_pm}} ,{{page.day2_am}} and {{page.day2_pm}}.

Participants should bring their laptops and plan to participate actively. By the end of the workshop learners should be able to more effectively manage and analyze data and be able to apply the tools and approaches directly to their ongoing research.
</p>

<!--
  AUDIENCE

  Explain who your audience is.  (In particular, tell readers if the
  workshop is only open to people from a particular institution.
-->
<p>
  <strong>Who:</strong>
  The course is aimed at graduate students and other researchers.

  SYLLABUS

  Show what topics will be covered.

  1. If your workshop is R rather than Python, remove the comment
     around that section and put a comment around the Python section.
  2. Some workshops will delete SQL.
  3. Please make sure the list of topics is synchronized with what you
     intend to teach.
  4. You may need to move the div's with class="col-md-6" around inside
     the div's with class="row" to balance the multi-column layout.

  This is one of the places where people frequently make mistakes, so
  please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
  'tools/check' as well.

  SETUP

  Delete irrelevant sections from the setup instructions.  Each
  section is inside a 'div' without any classes to make the beginning
  and end easier to find.

  This is the other place where people frequently make mistakes, so
  please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
  'tools/check' as well.
-->

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<p>
To participate in a Data Carpentry workshop, you will need working copies of the 
described software. Please make sure to install everything (or at least to download 
the installers) before the start of your workshop. Participants should bring and use 
their own laptops to insure the proper setup of tools for an efficient workflow 
once you leave the workshop.
<p>
Please follow these <a href=install.html>Setup Instructions</a>.

<p>
  We maintain a list of common issues that occur during installation as a reference for instructors
  that may be useful on the
  <a href = "https://github.com/swcarpentry/workshop-template/wiki/Configuration-Problems-and-Solutions">Configuration Problems and Solutions wiki page</a>.
